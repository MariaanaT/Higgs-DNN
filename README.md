# Searching Higgs boson with deep neural network

This work aims to replicate work presented in paper *Baldi, P., P. Sadowski, and D. Whiteson. “Searching for Exotic Particles in High-energy Physics with Deep Learning.” Nature Communications 5 (July 2, 2014).* Nevertheless, the original paper uses Pylearn2 to train neural networks, but Tensorflow and Keras are used in this work. 

The dataset can be downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS). Data set description can be found from the article. See also [code in GitHub](https://github.com/uci-igb/higgs-susy) used in the original work.
